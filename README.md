# CSDS335-Projects
Projects from Intro to Data Mining
### Project 1 
> Implelement Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and 10-fold CV from scratch, and apply them to given datasets for classification. 

### Project 2
> Utilize sklearn's clustering algorithms to cluster two gene datasets. Used k-means, DBSCAN, and spectral clustering. Used ARI to compare against ground truth labels to evaluate performances of the algorithms.
