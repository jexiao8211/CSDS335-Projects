# CSDS335-Projects
Projects from Intro to Data Mining
### Project 1 
> Collaboration with Vishwa Aduru
> Implelement Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and 10-fold CV from scratch, and apply them to given datasets for classification. 

### Project 2
> Utilize sklearn's clustering algorithms to cluster two gene datasets. Used k-means, DBSCAN, and spectral clustering. Used ARI to compare against ground truth labels to evaluate performances of the algorithms.

### Project 3
> Collaboration with Noah Hardy https://github.com/Noah-Hardy
> Create a recommender system for the MovieLens 100k dataset. Tuned and evaluated SVD, KNNBasic, CoClustering, and SlopeOne algorithms from the surprise python package.
